React's Hooks API but for standard web components and [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) or [hyperHTML](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/pxXrdy?editors=0010).

```html
<html lang="en">
  <my-counter></my-counter>

  <script type="module">
    import { html } from "https://unpkg.com/lit-html/lit-html.js";
    import { component, useState } from "https://unpkg.com/haunted/haunted.js";

    function Counter() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      return html`
        <div id="count">${count}</div>
        <button type="button" @click=${() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          Increment
        </button>
      `;
    }

    customElements.define("my-counter", component(Counter));
  </script>
</html>
```

## Getting started

A starter app is available on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/matthewp/haunted-starter-app/tree/master/) and also can be cloned from [this repo](https://github.com/matthewp/haunted-starter-app). This app gives you the basics of how to use Haunted and build components.

## Use

```shell
npm install haunted
```

For Internet Explorer 11, you'll need to use a proxy polyfill, in addition to the usual webcomponentsjs polyfills.

eg.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/proxy-polyfill@0.3.0/proxy.min.js"></script>
```

For a full example with Internet Explorer 11, see - https://github.com/crisward/haunted-ie11

You can also use Custom Elements without Shadow DOM if you wish.
eg.

```js
component(MyComponent, { useShadowDOM: false }));
```

### Importing

**Haunted** can be imported just like any other library when using a bundler of your choice:

```js
import { component, html, useState } from "haunted";
```

The main entry point is intended for [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html) users.

#### lighterhtml, etc

If you are using [lighterhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/lighterhtml) or [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML) then instead import `haunted/core`. This export gives you a function that creates Hooks that work with any template library.

```js
import haunted, { useState } from "haunted/core";
import { html, render } from "lighterhtml";

const { component } = haunted({
  render(what, where) {
    render(where, () => what);
  }
});

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return html`Using lighterhtml! Count: ${count}`;
}

customElements.define("my-app", component(App));
```

#### Web modules

**Haunted** can work directly in the browser without using any build tools. Simply import the `haunted.js` bundle. You can use the [unpkg] or [pika](https://www.pika.dev/cdn) CDNs. This works great for demo pages and small apps. Here's an example with unpkg:

```js
import { html } from "https://unpkg.com/lit-html/lit-html.js";
import {
  component,
  useState,
  useEffect
} from "https://unpkg.com/haunted/haunted.js";
```

If using pika then use the `html` export from Haunted, as pika bundles everything together:

```js
import { useState, component, html } from "https://cdn.pika.dev/haunted";
```

If you install Haunted **locally** this build is located at `node_modules/haunted/haunted.js`.

## API

Haunted is all about writing plain functions that can contain their own state. The follow docs is divided between creating _components_ (the functions) and using _hooks_ the state.

### Components

Components are functions that contain state and return HTML via lit-html or hyperHTML. Through the `component()` and `virtual()` they become connected to a lifecycle that keeps the HTML up-to-date when state changes.

Using Haunted you can create custom elements or _virtual_ components (components that contain state but have no element tag).

#### Custom elements

A Custom Element can be defined via haunted by passing your custom component you defined (e.g. `function App() {}`) to haunted's `component` function. You then take the result of your call to `component` and pass it to `customElements.define` like so:

```js
function App({ name }) {
  return html`Hello ${name}`;
}

customElements.define("my-app", component(App));
```

You can now use `<my-app></my-app>` anywhere you use HTML (directly in a `.html` file, in JSX, in lit-html templates, wherever).

##### Brief Digression:

Another way to write your component is with the arrow function syntax, or fat arrow. It offers a more concise and clean way to write your code, however, it does come with a one drawback:

There's no way to use the `this` keyword to refer to the instance of your web component that is running.

```js
const App = ({ name }) => {
  console.log(this); // => "undefined"
  return html`Hello ${name}!`;
};
```

##### Rendering

Now that we have access to `<my-app>` in all HTML, what if you want to render it from JavaScript?

In this instance, we're using lit-html which comes with a `render` function. You can utilize it by passing in your HTML template and the element you wish to render the template into:

```js
import { render, html } from "lit-html";

render(
  html`<my-app name="world"></my-app>`,
  document.body
);
```

##### Attributes

In custom elements, attributes must be pre-defined. To define what attributes your component supports, set the `observedAttributes` property on the function you defined.

```js
function App({ name }) {
  return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

App.observedAttributes = ["name"];

customElements.define("my-app", component(App));
```

Alternatively, you can pass `observedAttributes` as an option to `component()`:

```js
component(App, { observedAttributes: ["name"] });
```

Once your custom element is defined you can then pass in attributes as you would with any other HTML element.

```html
<my-app name="World"></my-app>
```

#### Virtual components

Haunted also has the concept of _virtual components_. These are components that are not defined as a tag. Rather they are functions that can be called from within another template. They have their own state and will rerender when that state changes, _without_ causing any parent components to rerender.

The following is an example of using virtual components:

```js
import { useState, virtual, component } from "haunted";
import { html, render } from "lit-html";

const Counter = virtual(() => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return html`
    <button type="button" @click=${() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      ${count}
    </button>
  `;
});

function App() {
  return html`
    <main>
      <h1>My app</h1>
      ${Counter()}
    </main>
  `;
}

customElements.define("my-app", component(App));
```

Notice that we have `Counter`, a virtual component, and `App`, a custom element. You can use virtual components within custom elements and custom elements within virtual components.

The only difference is that custom elements are used by using their tag name (e.g. `<my-app>`) and virtual components are called as functions.

If you wanted you could create an entire app of virtual components.

##### Virtual components and `this`

You'll notice that in the above examples, we're using the fat arrow syntax. This is due to virtual components not being attached to any actual custom elements, therefore, `this` never points to anything negating the purpose of using the function syntax.

### Hooks

Haunted supports the same API as React Hooks. The hope is that by doing so you can reuse hooks available on npm simply by aliasing package names in your bundler's config.

Currently Haunted supports the following hooks:

#### useState

Returns an array of two values. The first value is the immutable state that is initialized to the argument you pass in. The second value is the function that is used to change the first value (the setter).

When the setter is called, the element in which the state resides is rerendered.

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

Additionally if you provide a function as the argument to `useState`, the function is called to initialize the first state, but never called again.

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(() => {
  return expensiveComputation(42);
});
```

#### useEffect

Used to run a side-effect when the component rerenders or when a dependency changes. To run your side-effect only when the component rerenders, only pass in your side-effect function and nothing else:

```html
<my-counter></my-counter>

<script type="module">
  import { html } from "https://unpkg.com/lit-html/lit-html.js";
  import {
    component,
    useState,
    useEffect
  } from "https://unpkg.com/haunted/haunted.js";

  function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
      // on every rerender, a new number will be in the title
      document.title = `A random number ${Math.random()}`;
    });

    return html`
      <div id="count">${count}</div>
      <button type="button" @click=${() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Cause rerender
      </button>
    `;
  }

  customElements.define("my-counter", component(Counter));
</script>
```

##### Dependencies

What happens when your code begins to rely on dependencies that can change (state, refs, props)? We no longer want it to rerun on every rerender so we need to ensure that the code we're running, or its result, doesn't become stale. To do this, you should always state all of the dependencies you're using in an array as the second argument to `useEffect`:

```js
function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Dracula");

  useEffect(() => {
    // This only occurs when `name` changes and on the initial render.
    document.title = `Hello ${name}`;
  }, [name]);

  return html`...`;
}
```

A dependency is anything that your side-effect relies on that can change between renders (e.g. state, refs, props). This does not include `setName` or other setters from `useState` because they will never change between renders.

###### What if I want to run the side-effect on mount?

Generally, you won't want to do this but rather make sure you're actually listing all of your dependencies in the dependency array. If you don't have any dependencies then your code will run on mount and clean up on unmount.

Here is an example of only running an effect once as opposed to every rerender:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = "I'll stay like this until someone changes me"
}, []); // note that you must pass the empty array
```

##### Cleaning up side-effects

Since effects are used for side-effectual things and might run many times in the lifecycle of a component, `useEffect` supports returning a teardown function.

An example of when you might use this is if you are setting up an event listener.

```js
function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Wolf Man");

  useEffect(() => {
    function updateNameFromWorker(event) {
      setName(event.data);
    }

    worker.addEventListener("message", updateNameFromWorker);

    return () => {
      worker.removeEventListener("message", updateNameFromWorker);
    };
  }, []); // note that it is safe to exclude `setName` from the dependencies because it will never change

  return html`...`;
}
```

#### useLayoutEffect

The function signature is the same as `useEffect`, but the callback is being called synchronously after rendering. Therefore, updates scheduled inside `useLayoutEffect` will be flushed synchronously before the browser has a chance to paint.

Most of time, it is preferable to use `useEffect` to avoid blocking visual updates.

#### useReducer

Create state that updates after being ran through a reducer function.

```html
<my-counter></my-counter>

<script type="module">
  import { html } from "https://unpkg.com/lit-html/lit-html.js";
  import { component, useReducer } from "https://unpkg.com/haunted/haunted.js";

  const initialState = { count: 0 };

  function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case "reset":
        return initialState;
      case "increment":
        return { count: state.count + 1 };
      case "decrement":
        return { count: state.count - 1 };
    }
  }

  function Counter() {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

    return html`
      Count: ${state.count}
      <button @click=${() => dispatch({ type: "reset" })}>
        Reset
      </button>
      <button @click=${() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
      <button @click=${() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
    `;
  }

  customElements.define("my-counter", component(Counter));
</script>
```

#### useMemo

Create a memoized state value. Only reruns the function when dependent values have changed.

```html
<my-app></my-app>

<script type="module">
  import { html } from "https://unpkg.com/lit-html/lit-html.js";
  import {
    component,
    useMemo,
    useState
  } from "https://unpkg.com/haunted/haunted.js";

  function fibonacci(num) {
    if (num <= 1) return 1;
    return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2);
  }

  function App() {
    const [value, setVal] = useState(12);
    const fib = useMemo(() => fibonacci(value), [value]);

    return html`
      <h1>Fibonacci</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        @change=${event => setVal(parseInt(event.target.value, 10))}
        value=${value}
      />
      <div>Fibonacci <strong>${fib}</strong></div>
    `;
  }

  customElements.define("my-app", component(App));
</script>
```

#### useRef

Creates and returns a mutable object (a 'ref') whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument.

This differs from `useState` in that state is immutable and can only be changed via `setState` which **will** cause a rerender. That rerender will allow you to be able to see the updated `state` value. A ref, on the other hand, can only be changed via `.current` and since changes to it are mutations, no rerender is required to view the updated value in your component's code (e.g. listeners, callbacks, effects).

```html
<my-app></my-app>

<script type="module">
  import { html } from "https://unpkg.com/lit-html/lit-html.js";
  import { component, useRef } from "https://unpkg.com/haunted/haunted.js";

  function App() {
    const myRef = useRef(0);
    return html`${myRef.current}`;
  }

  customElements.define("my-app", component(App));
</script>
```

#### useContext

Grabs the context value from the closest provider above and updates your component, the consumer, whenever the provider changes the value.

`useContext` currently only works with custom element components, [track the issue here](https://github.com/matthewp/haunted/issues/40).

```html
<my-app></my-app>

<script type="module">
  import { html } from "https://unpkg.com/lit-html/lit-html.js";
  import {
    component,
    createContext,
    useContext
  } from "https://unpkg.com/haunted/haunted.js";

  const ThemeContext = createContext("dark");

  customElements.define("theme-provider", ThemeContext.Provider);
  customElements.define("theme-consumer", ThemeContext.Consumer);

  function Consumer() {
    const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return context;
  }

  customElements.define("my-consumer", component(Consumer));

  function App() {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");

    return html`
      <select value=${theme} @change=${event => setTheme(event.target.value)}>
        <option value="dark">Dark</option>
        <option value="light">Light</option>
      </select>

      <theme-provider .value=${theme}>
        <my-consumer></my-consumer>

        <!-- creates context with inverted theme -->
        <theme-provider .value=${theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark"}>
          <theme-consumer
            .render=${value =>
              html`<h1>${value}</h1>`
            }
          ></theme-consumer>
        </theme-provider>
      </theme-provider>
    `;
  }

  customElements.define("my-app", component(App));
</script>
```

#### Write Your Own Hook

Most functionality can be achieved with the provided hooks above, but you can also create your own hooks for custom functionality like so:

```js
import { hook, Hook } from 'haunted';

const useMyHook = hook(class extends Hook {
  constructor(id, state) {
    super(id, state);
    // ...
  }

  update() { /* ... */ }
  teardown() { /* ... */ }
});
```

### State

At its heart, Haunted is a container for state derived from hooks. The `component` and `virtual` signatures build on top of this state container.

In order to use Haunted outside of its component types, such as to extend another custom element base class, you can use the `State` constructor.

It has a signature of: `new State(update, [ hostElement ])`.

> Note that the second argument `hostElement` is optional. If you want to use the `useContext` hook you will need to provide a host element, however.

Here's an example how it can be used to run hooks code:

```js
import { State, useState } from "haunted";

let state = new State(() => {
  update();
});

function update() {
  state.run(() => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    console.log("count is", count);

    setTimeout(() => setCount(count + 1), 3000);
  });
}

update();
```

The above will result in the count being incremented every 3 seconds and the current count being logged.

A more practical example is integration with a custom element base class. Here's a simple integration with [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/):

```js
import { LitElement } from "lit-element";
import { State } from "haunted";

export default class LitHauntedElement extends LitElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.hauntedState = new State(() => this.requestUpdate(), this);
  }

  update(changedProperties) {
    this.hauntedState.run(() => super.update(changedProperties));
    this.hauntedState.runEffects();
  }

  disconnectedCallback() {
    super.disconnectedCallback();
    this.hauntedState.teardown();
  }
}
```

More example integrations can be found in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/matthewp/92c4daa6588eaef484c6f389d20d5700).

### Function Signatures

`component(renderer, options): Element`
`component(renderer, BaseElement, options): Element`

- renderer = `` (element) => html`...` ``
- BaseElement = `HTMLElement`
- options = `{baseElement: HTMLElement, observedAttributes: [], useShadowDOM: true}`

`virtual(renderer): directive`

- renderer = `` (element) => html`...` ``
