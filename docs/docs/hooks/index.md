# Hooks

Haunted supports the same API as React Hooks. The hope is that by doing so you can reuse hooks available on npm simply by aliasing package names in your bundler's config.

Currently Haunted supports the following hooks:

- [useCallback](./useCallback/)
- [useContext](./useContext/)
- [useController](./useController/)
- [useEffect](./useEffect/)
- [useLayoutEffect](./useLayoutEffect/)
- [useMemo](./useMemo/)
- [useReducer](./useReducer/)
- [useRef](./useRef/)
- [useState](./useState/)
